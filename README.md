# Front-End Playground

Welcome to my **Front-End Playground**! 🎨💻  

This repository contains **32 HTML & CSS practice projects** that I built to improve my front-end development skills. Each project focuses on different HTML structures, CSS styling, and responsive design techniques.  

## 📂 Project Structure

- Each practice project is inside its own folder:
```
HTML_CSS/
├─ assets/
│ └─ favicon.svg
├─ css/
│ ├─ output.css
│ └─ style.css
├─ P01/
├─ P02/
├─ P03/
...
├─ P32/
└─ index.html
```
- Every folder contains an `index.html` file showcasing that particular practice.

- There is also a **main `index.html`** in the root folder that serves as a **hub**. It has links to all 32 practice projects for easy navigation.
